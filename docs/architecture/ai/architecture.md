# AI Architecture

## Overview

Our AI architecture is designed to provide a scalable and flexible framework for building and deploying AI models. The architecture is based on a microservices approach, with each component designed to be highly modular and reusable.

## Components

*   **Data Ingestion**: Responsible for collecting and processing data from various sources.
*   **Model Training**: Responsible for training and validating AI models using the ingested data.
*   **Model Deployment**: Responsible for deploying trained models to production environments.
*   **Model Serving**: Responsible for serving deployed models and handling incoming requests.

## Data Flow

1.  Data is ingested from various sources and processed into a standardized format.
2.  The processed data is then used to train and validate AI models.
3.  Trained models are deployed to production environments.
4.  Deployed models are served and handle incoming requests.

## Benefits

*   Scalable and flexible architecture
*   Highly modular and reusable components
*   Easy to integrate with existing systems
*   Supports a wide range of AI models and frameworks
